title: Global Income Inequality
subtitle: Are the resources produced by a country euqally distributed among the citizens?
---

In order to dig inside this question we decied to study how the income are distributed among the different country.

Indeed, in the previous researches we discover how there are countries which are more responsable of the production in term of crops and livestock. Production in general, but also in term of agriculture and live stocks, causes emission of $CO_{2}$ which is one of the main causes of the Climate Change.

Of course, we can not target the production as BAD a priori. Indeed, prodcution is important for the economic of each country. One important think to know, about the countries we are dealing with, is how the incomes are distributed, so if the resources earned by production are then distributed to the inhabitants.

Sometimes, it happens, over the years, the economic of a country led to the phenomenon call Matthew Effect, which can be resumed in the phrase "the rich get richer and the poor get poorer".

In FAO dataset there were no informatin about this aspect, we need to achieved more data from the World Inequality Database (here).
The WID aims to provide open and convenient access to the most extensive available database on the historical evolution of the world distribution of income and wealth, both within countries and between countries.
