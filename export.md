subtitle: Which are the most important countries as for international trade on agricultural products?

When looking at the emissions in agriculture some countries perform noticeably worse than others. But now the question is: are they responsible for the pollution they produce or is this a commodity of the wealthiest countries that delocalize their production? Such countries usually hold up China, India or Brazil for their emissions, but are they free of guilt?

In order to provide a further insight on such controversial theme, we dig into the FAO trade indices. Countries are evaluated both for their absolute value of import/export and for values normalized on their total production. Since the FAO data includes re-export data, countries that are main players in the agriculture trade economy will be on top of such ranking.

**Immagine con i ranking?**

If we investigate in which countries are among top 15 exporting and importing nations, we notice that none among the most polluting ones only China and USA are present in the list.
All the other countries are mainly European countries that trade between each other.

*All the data refers to the mean of 2000-2017 period*

As we see from network above, small countries such as UAE or Luxemburg and major European countries are on top as for the export/production ratio. 
If we then consider the total export values, we can retrieve some of the most debated countries as the United States or Brazil, but China and India are still out of the top ten and further in the ranking.
If we look at their export data, we notice that they only a minimal part of their production is exported to other countries. Both China’s and India’s exports don’t even reach the 5 % of over their total production.
As expected, these countries have the largest trades with the closest countries. For instance, the first country China exports to is Japan or for Canada the main
If we then check where these trades are directed to, we notice that most of these countries are tightly bonded with the United States. When looking at where they import from, we notice that a large part of the Mexican and Canadian agricultural production is consumed by the United States.
To further analyze the centrality of the trading countries we first measured the centrality in the network of the trade absolute values. USA, Germany and Japan are the main players in the absolute value of agriculture trade, but such result is highly depending on the size of the country and its production capacity.
Therefore, the centrality of the countries was also evaluated by considering the ratio between the export and the production. The results drastically change since the possibility for the European countries to exchange their products without strict regulation bring these countries to monopolize the top central trading countries. The only non-European countries in the top ten are USA and Russia.
